## Description

**SIMPCCe** is an innovative simulation tool designed to assess the effects of climate change on water reservoirs. Its goal is to make advanced modeling methodologies accessible without requiring users to write code or install complex dependencies.

### Main Features

1. **Hydrometeorological Data Analysis**  
   Integrates historical records with projected climate data to estimate impacts on reservoir behavior.

2. **Artificial Intelligence Integration**  
   Applies **machine learning** and **neural networks** for pattern recognition and hydrological forecasting.

3. **Climate Scenario Generation**  
   Enables the creation and comparison of various future climate change scenarios to evaluate reservoir resilience.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   Allows users to configure simulations and analyze results intuitively, with no programming knowledge required.
