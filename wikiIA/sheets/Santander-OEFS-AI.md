### Context

Operational systems based on physical modelling are powerful tools to predict and forecast meteo-oceanographic variables. As a counterpart, these tools normally require high computational demands and/or long computational windows to provide results to end users. 

To strike a balance between these requirements and optimal result accuracy, a deep learning neural network has been trained to forecast water levels and current velocity fields in the Bay of Santander.

### Description

Based on a calibrated and validated implementation of a hydrodynamic physical model of the Bay of Santander, a system of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks has been trained to replicate the outputs of the physical system.

This AI-based system provides high-resolution water levels and surface currents in **just a few minutes**, as opposed to the hours required by the traditional numerical model.

It can forecast **over 72 hours** of hydrodynamic variables using only predicted time series of the main regional drivers at a single location.

### Insights

üåä **3-day hourly forecasts** of water level and surface currents in the Bay of Santander.  
‚è≥ **Significant reduction** in resources needed to maintain the system, with reasonable accuracy.  
üí° Enables research in deep learning vs. traditional modelling through intercomparison studies.
